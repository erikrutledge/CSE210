## Introduction & Rules
---
Welcome to Hilo, the game where you guess High or Low!

Rules of the game are simple, a card will be drawn randomly from the deck and you have to decide if 
the next one will be higher or lower. 

Scoring is simple, you start at 300 points and gain 100 points for guessing correctly. If you don't
guess right you lose 75 points. Play as long as you'd like, there is no point limit and it won't stop
you if you need to go negative. You could always come back and win big! 

The only limit to the game are the number of cards. The deck it uses is updated at the cards are 
drawn meaning only 4 of each value are in the deck, and once they're used up they won't be placed back
in. Try playing all 52 cards and see how many points you can get!

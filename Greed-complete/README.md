## The Game of Greed
This game is all about colleting gems and avoiding rocks. Each gem gives +1 point, each rock takes 1 point away. There is no end goal, just go as long as you can and get the highest score! Press [escape] to exit or click the x in the corner of the window then you've played enough.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.

```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Introduction & Rules
---
Welcome to Jumper

This game is a variant of hangman where the objective is to guess a word. Jumper randomly selects one of 
+400 words to be the target and prompts the user to guess it letter by letter, but be careful because each
wrong guess eliminates one of your parachute strings. The game ends once you correctly guess the word or 
have 5 incorrect guesses, whichever comes first.  

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 jumper
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the jumper folder and click the "run" button.

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
